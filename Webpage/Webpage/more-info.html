    <h2>Whats makes Direct Drive so good?</h2>
    <p>      Direct Drive is the best type of wheel to get because of its method with the motor. Wheels such as 
      the T150, Fanatec CSL Elite's, And most consumer-grade wheels use a belt system or a gear system. 
      The vast majority use belt, However. Direct Drive wheels remove the belt/gear system completely. 
      The motor directly goes to the wheel instead of going through the belt system. The reason Direct 
      Drive wheels are so expensive is because, Without the belt system, It gives you so much more 
      pure force feedback than with the consumer belts. Since the belts are removed, Your going to need 
      a more powerful motor, Which is going to cost more money. This results in a much more expensive 
      wheelset then otherwise.</p>

    <h2>The Cost</h2>
    <p>      As I said earlier, Sim Racing isn't cheap. The wheel I have comes around $250 and thats a beginner wheel.
Another wheel which is a good start is the Thrustmaster T80, Which has no force feedback but is only 100 Dollars.
Direct Drive wheels come in around $1500-$7000 depending on what your getting. Yeah, Pricy.</p>

    <h2>What simulator should you use?</h2>
    <p>I suggest not using iRacing to start, as its super expensive and solely focussed on Online Multiplayer,
There is no way to practice unless around others. There are other options out there. Here a few really good
sims to start with: Assetto Corsa, Project Cars 2, rFactor 2. If your into rally there is Dirt Rally 2.0, WRC 8,
Richard Burns Rally (2004 game, Still holds up in realism)</p>
