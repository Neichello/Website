<h1>My Hobby</h1>
<hr>
<h2 class="Sim-Racing">Sim Racing</h2>
<p>Sim Racing is my favorite hobby, I like Sim Racing because the thrill of it. I race on 'iRacing'
and believe its the best simulator. I currently have a Thrustmaster T150 and have the
Fanatec CSL Elite LC Pedals. Sim Racing isn't cheap, Infact far from it. The wheel any
Sim Racer wants is a Direct Drive wheel. These wheels are the top class wheels and provide the
best experience of any Sim Racing.</p>

<h2>Types of Sim Racing</h2>
<p>There are many types of Sim Racing you can do. While the vast majority sticks to Road Racing
  (Circuits, Etc) Plenty of drivers (Including me), go to Oval Racing (Stock Cars, Dirt Cars) or
  Dirt Racing. Each provides A different experience and I suggest checking them all out!</p>
